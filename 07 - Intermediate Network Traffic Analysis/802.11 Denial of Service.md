A prominent type of link-layer attack is the one directed at 802.11 (Wi-Fi).

## Capturing 802.11 Traffic

To examine that traffic, we would require a WIDS/WIPS system or a wireless interface equipped with monitor mode.
Then analyze it through aircrack-ng suite.

## How Deauthentication Attacks Work

This is a commonplace link-layer precursor attack that adversaries might employ for several reasons:
1. To capture the WPA handshake to perform an offline dictionary attack.
2. To cause general denial of service conditions
3. To enforce users to disconnect from our network, and potentially join their network to retrieve information.

In essence, the attacker will fabricate a deauthentication frame pretending it originates from our legitimate access point.
The client device cannot really discern the difference without additional controls like IEEE 802.11w (Management Frame Protection).

## Finding Deauthentication Attacks

First we can limit our view to traffic from our AP's BSSID (MAC): `wlan.bssid == ...`.
Then, if we want to take a look at the deauthentication frames from our BSSID/attacker pretending to send these from our BSSID, we can use: `wlan.fc.type == 00 and wlan.fc.type_subtype == 12`.
00 for "management" and 12 for "deauthentication".
We might notice an excessive amount of deauth frames were sent to one of our client devices. Also, the reason code 7 was utilized, used by default by aireplay-ng and mdk4.
We can also filter for the reason code like this: `wlan.fixed.reason_code == 7`.

## Revolving Reason Codes

An attacker may change the reason code to evade detection, so we must search through them all.
Deauthentication can be a pain to deal with, but there are some compensating measures that we can implement to prevent this from occurring:
1. Enable IEEE 802.11w if possible.
2. Utilize WPA3-SAE.
3. Modify our WIDS/WIPS detection rules.

To find failed authentication attempts, we may filter the subtypes 0, 1 and 11 and analyze them.
