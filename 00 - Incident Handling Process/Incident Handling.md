- Incident - an event with a negative consequence (clear intent to cause harm that is performed against a computer system)
- Incident Handling - clearly defined set of procedures to manage and respond to incidents in a computer or network environment

It isn't just about intrusion incidents, it also includes incidents caused by malicious insiders, availability issues and loss of intellectual property.
