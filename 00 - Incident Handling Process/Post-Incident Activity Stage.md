In this stage, our objective is to document the incident and improve our capabilities based on lessons learned from it.
This information is best gathered and analysed in a meeting with all the stakeholders that were involved, taking place within a few days after the incident, when the report has been finalized.
## Reporting

The final report is a crucial part of the entire process. A complete report will contain answers to the questions:
- What happened and when?
- Performance of the team dealing with the incident in regard to plans, playbooks, policies and procedures
- Did the business provide the necessary information and respond promptly to aid in handling the incident in an efficient manner? What can be improved?
- What actions have been implemented to contain and eradicate the incident?
- What preventive measures should be put in place to prevent similar incidents in the future?
- What tools and resources are needed to detect and analyze similar incidents in the future?

Such reports can provide us with measurable results.
Additionally, incident reports also provide a reference for handling future events of similar nature.
In situations where legal action is to be taken, it will also be used in court and as a source for identifying the costs and impact of incidents.
This stage is a great place to train new team members by showing how the incident was handled by more experienced colleagues.
It is also important to reevaluate the tools, training and readiness of the team.
