## Logging Basics

Windows Event Logs store logs form different components of the system including the system itself, applications running on it, ETW providers, services and others.
The logs are categorized into different event logs, such as *Application*, *System*, *Security* and others.
To access them, use Event Viewer or Windows Event Log API.
Saved logs are .evtx files and can be opened in the viewer.
## The Anatomy of an Event Log

Application logs have 2 distinct levels of events:
- *information* - provide general usage details about the app, such as its start or stop events.
- *error* - highlight specific errors and often offer detailed insights into the encountered issues.

Each entry is an "Event" and contains some components:
- Log name - Name of the event log.
- Source - Software that logged the event.
- Event ID - Unique identifier for the event.
- Task Category - Value or name that can help us understand the purpose or use of the event.
- Level - The severity of the event (*Information*, *Warning*, *Error*, *Critical* and *Verbose*).
- Keywords - Flags that allow us to categorize events. These are generally broad categories.
- User - User account that was logged on when the event occurred.
- OpCode - Identifier of the specific operation that the event reports.
- Logged - Date and time when the event was logged.
- Computer - Name of the computer where the event occurred.
- XML Data - All of the above information in an XML format, along with additional event data.

## Leveraging Custom XML Queries

To streamline our analysis, we can create custom XML queries to identify related events using the "Logon ID" as a starting point.
![[example_xml_query.webp]]
This query focuses on events containing the "SubjectLogonId" field with a value of "0x3E7"

## Useful Windows Event Logs

Find below an indicative (non-exhaustive) list of useful Windows event logs.
