## Malware Definition

Short for malicious software, encompasses various types of software designed to infiltrate, exploit or damage computer systems, network and data.

The specific objectives of malware can vary among different threat actors, falling into:
- Disrupting host system operations
- Stealing critical information, including personal and financial data
- Gaining unauthorized access to systems
- Conducting espionage activities
- Sending spam messages
- Utilizing the victim's system for DDoS attacks
- Implementing ransomware to lock up victim's files on their host and demanding ransom

## Malware Types

Let's peel back the layers of some commonly seen types of malware:
- Viruses - designed to infiltrate and multiply within host files.
- Worms - autonomous malware capable of multiplying across networks without needing human intervention.
- Trojans - disguised an genuine software to trick users into running them.
- Ransomware - encrypts files on the target's system, making them unreachable, and demand a ransom in return for the decryption key.
- Spyware - gathers sensitive data and user activities without their consent.
- Adware - shows uninvited and invasive advertisements on infected systems.
- Botnets - networks of compromised devices, referred to as bots or zombies, controlled by a central C2 server.
- Rootkits - designed to gain unauthorized access and control over the root of an operating system.
- Backdoors/RATs - crafted to offer unauthorized access and control over compromised systems from remote locations.
- Droppers - used to transport and install extra malicious payloads onto infected systems.
- Information Stealers - tailored to target and extract sensitive data.

## Malware Samples

- [ANY.RUN](https://app.any.run/): an interactive online sandbox for malware analysis.
- [Contagio Malware Dump](https://contagiodump.blogspot.com/): a collection of malware samples, threat reports, and related resources curated by a malware researcher named Mila.
- [VX Underground](https://www.vx-underground.org/): one of the largest collections of malware source code, articles, and papers on the internet. It aims to collect, preserve, and share all kinds of materials related to malware, exploit, and hacking culture.

## Malware/Evidence Acquisition

When it comes to gathering evidence, having the right tools to perform disk imaging and memory acquisition is crucial.

##### Disk Imaging Solutions
- [FTK Imager](https://www.exterro.com/ftk-imager): allows us to create perfect copies (or images) of computer disks for analysis, preserving the integrity of the evidence. It also lets us view and analyze the contents of data storage devices without altering the data.
- [OSFClone](https://www.osforensics.com/tools/create-disk-images.html): open-source utility designed for the task of creating and cloning forensic disk images. It's easy to use and supports a wide variety of file systems.
- `DD and DCFLDD`: Both are command-line utilities available on Unix-based systems.

##### Memory Acquisition Solutions
- [DumpIt](https://www.magnetforensics.com/resources/magnet-dumpit-for-windows/): generates a physical memory dump of Windows and Linux machines.
- [MemDump](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html): free, straightforward command-line utility that enables us to capture the contents of a system's RAM.
- [Belkasoft RAM Capturer](https://belkasoft.com/ram-capturer): can capture the RAM of a running Windows computer, even if there's active anti-debugging or anti-dumping protection.
- [Magnet RAM Capture](https://www.magnetforensics.com/resources/magnet-ram-capture/): provides a free and simple way to capture the volatile memory of a system.
- [LiME (Linux Memory Extractor)](https://github.com/504ensicsLabs/LiME): LiME is a Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) which allows the acquisition of volatile memory.

##### Other Solutions
- [KAPE (Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor)](https://www.kroll.com/en/services/cyber-risk/incident-response-litigation-support/kroll-artifact-parser-extractor-kape): triage program designed to help in collecting and parsing artifacts in a quick and effective manner.
- [Velociraptor](https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor): versatile tool designed for host-based incident response and digital forensics. It allows for quick, targeted data collection across a wide number of machines.

## Malware Analysis Definition, Purpose & Common Activities

It's the process of comprehending the behavior and inner workings of malware, a crucial aspect of cybersecurity that aids in understanding the threat posed by malicious software.

It serves several pivotal purposes, such as:
- Detection and Classification - identify and categorize different types of threats based on their unique characteristics, signatures or patterns.
- Reverse Engineering - the malware's code, to discern its underlying operations and employed techniques.
- Behavioral Analysis - gain insights into its actions, such as modifications to the file system, network communications, changes to the system registry and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities.
- Threat Intelligence - amass critical intelligence about attackers, their TTPs and malware origins.

The techniques employed encompass a wire array of methods and tools, including:
- **Static Analysis** - scrutinizing the malware's code without executing it.
- **Dynamic Analysis** - executing the malware within a controlled environment to observe its behavior and capture its runtime activities.
- **Code Analysis** - disassembling or decompiling code to understand its logic, functions, algorithms and employed techniques.
- **Memory Analysis** - analyzing the malware's interactions with system memory.
- **Malware Unpacking** - extracting and isolating the hidden malicious code within a piece of malware that uses packing techniques to evade detection.

As cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, we must continually enhance our capabilities to identify, analyze and mitigate the risks posed by malicious software.
