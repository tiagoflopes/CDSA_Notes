In this one, we aim to create a visualization to monitor user additions or removals from the local "Administrators" group.
This will be based on:
- 4732 - A member was added to a security-enabled local group.
- 4733 - A member was removed from a security-enabled local group.

This is the resulting table:
![[users_added_or_removed.png]]
