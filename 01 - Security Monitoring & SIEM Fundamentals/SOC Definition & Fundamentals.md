## What Is A SOC

A Security Operations Center is an essential facility that houses a team of information security experts responsible for continuously monitoring and evaluating an organization's security mix.
The team collaborates closely with organizational incident response teams to guarantee security concerns are promptly detected and resolved.
SIEM systems, IDS/IPS and EDR tools are utilized by the SOC team. They also make use of threat intelligence and engage in threat hunting initiatives.
In summary, a SOC objectives lie within minimizing the consequences of a security breach and decreasing the likelihood of future attacks.
