## What is SIEM?

Security Information and Event Management encompasses the utilization of software offerings and solutions that merge the management of security data with the supervision of security events. These facilitate real-time evaluations of alerts produced by network hardware and applications.
Some of the core functionalities it possesses are: the collection and administration of log events, the capacity to examine them and supplementary data from various sources as well as incident handling, visual summaries and documentation.
Employing SIEM innovations, IT personnel can detect cyber attacks at the time or even prior to their occurrence, thereby enhancing the speed of their response.

## The Evolution of SIEM Technology

The acronym emerged from the amalgamation of two preceding technologies: SIM and SEM. First-generation SIM technology was developed upon conventional log collection management systems, while the second-generation SEM technology tackled security events by delivering consolidation, correlation and notification of events from a range of security apparatuses, such as antivirus, firewalls, IDS, and SNMP traps, servers and databases, disclosed by authentication.

## How Does A SIEM Solution Work?

SIEM systems gather data from a variety of sources, including PCs, network devices, servers and more. Then, this data gets standardized and consolidated to facilitate ease of analysis. The platform employs security experts who scrutinize the data in order to identify and detect potential threats, which allows businesses to locate security breaches and examine alerts.
Alerts notify Security Operations/Monitoring personnel that they must look into a (possible) security event or incident. These alerts are concise and can be conveyed through emails, text messages, phone call, etc.
This systems generate a lot of events, so fine-tuning the SIEM for detecting and alerting on high-risk events is crucial.
The capacity to accurately pinpoint high-risk events is what distinguishes SIEM from other network monitoring tools (IDS and IPS). By integrating data from numerous sources, these solutions deliver a holistic strategy for threat detection and management.

## SIEM Business Requirements & Use Cases

### Log Aggregation & Normalization
The importance of threat visibility through log consolidation cannot be overstated. It entails gathering terabytes of security information from vital firewalls, confidential databases and essential applications. This process empowers the SOC team to examine the data and discern connections, significantly improving threat visibility.
This approach allows organization to recognize patterns, tendencies and irregularities that could suggest potential security hazards, consequently reducing the repercussions on the organization.
### Threat Alerting
This feature is critical as it allows IT security team to carry out swifter and more targeted investigations and respond to potential security incidents in a timely and efficient manner.
### Contextualization & Response
Merely generating alerts is not enough. Threat contextualization is crucial for sorting through alerts, determining the actors involved in the security event, the affected parts of the network and the timing.
Automated configuration processes can filter some contextualized threats, reducing the number of alerts received by the team.
An ideal SIEM solution should allow an enterprise to directly manage threats, often by stopping operations while investigations take place.
### Compliance
Regulations like PCI DSS, HIPAA and GDPR mandate organizations to implement robust security measures, including real-time monitoring and analysis of network traffic. SIEM solutions can help organizations fulfill these requirements.
Automated reporting and auditing capabilities are also provided by those, which are essential for compliance, and makes it easy to demonstrate compliance ti auditors and regulators.

## Data Flows Within A SIEM

This is how data travels within a SIEM, until it is ready for analysis:
1. SIEM solutions ingest logs from various data sources. Each tool possesses unique capabilities for collecting logs from different sources. Also known as data ingestion or data collection.
2. The gathered data is processed and normalized to be understood by the SIEM correlation engine. Also known as data normalization or data aggregation.
3. SOC teams utilize the normalized data collected by the SIEM to create various detection rules, dashboards, visualizations, alerts and incidents.

## What Are The Benefits Of Using A SIEM Solution

Assuming that the security control is safeguarding something of higher importance, it is evident that the advantages significantly overweight the potential risks associated with not having a SIEM system.
Without it, IT personnel would not have a centralized perspective on all logs and events, which could result in overlooking crucial events and accumulating a large number of events awaiting investigation.
More sophisticated SIEMs are now integrating AI to notify based on behavioral and pattern analysis.
Numerous regulated organizations are mandated to have a managed SIEM.
